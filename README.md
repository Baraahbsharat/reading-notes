# Growth mindset :v:
## Having a growth mindset means being ready to fight against whatever you face in your road toward your goal. 
## This neccessary to make our life as meaningful and interesting as possibe.:muscle:
## As a person who had a growth mindset you are beleiving in the presnce of the chance to develop your abilites all the time.
## When you face a **challenge** if you had a growth mindset you mustn't give up! 
## You must carefuly studied what you did, search about the mistakes and correct it to complete. 
## When you find ***obstcales*** don't escape, just focus and keep trying. 
## Making an **efort** will keep your spirit strong and give a fuel for your daily life. 
## It's important to **evaluate** your actions daily, to know which aspects need more care than others. 
## Finally keep your looking toward the other successful as an inspiration to you. 
## AS Eleanor Roosevelt said 
> ***For our own success to be real, it must contribute to the success of others***.
## To my own mind as @BaraaBsharat I want to say 
## 1. Keep your eyes toward the goal all the time 
## 2. Don't be worry about obstcales, you can complete 
## 3. Show as much effort as you can 
## 4. Don't forget to evaluate your works along your way
