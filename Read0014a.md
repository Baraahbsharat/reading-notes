Transforms refers to general layout techniques to change the element properties we have two-dimensional ( which includes 2D Rotate, 2D Translate, 2D Skew) and three-dimensional (need a perspective from which to transform to work with the element and includes 3D Rotate, 3D Translate, 3D Skew, 
transform transform property followed by the value is the syntax. we can combine transforms together. The default  transform property is 50% vertically and 50 % horizontally to change this we can use transform origin, To alter the appearance and the behavior of an element we use transitions ( for example background color, background position, border-color and border width), transition duration used to determine the duration in which the element take place, and to determine the speed we use transition timing, to determine the direction an animations complete we use animation direction while animation play state either cause running or pausing to the animation, 8 simple transition effect includes ( Fade in,  change color, grow & shrink, rotate elements, square to circle, 3D shadow, swing, inset border), while to alter these in multiple keyframes we use Animations.
