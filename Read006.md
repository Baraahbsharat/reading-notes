Objects (in curly braces)  contain variables(called prosperities inside object)  and functions(called method inside object) to make a model for something from the real world. Both of variable and method had a name and a value(can be any type of data or another object) that called key.We use Literal notation to create objects, we can access the object either by dot notation or by square brackets. 
The document object model (DOM) make a model for the HTML page, and determine how the javascript can reach the content and update it, The model called a DOM tree and it stores in the browsers memory, It is  components are four types of nodes (document, element, attributes and text nodes). Each nodes is an object with methods and and properties, Dom queries are methods to find the elements in DOM tree, storing elements in a variable means storing a location of that element in the DOM tree. Dom queries may return one value or a NodeList, We have tow types of nodelist (live and static), and to select element from it we can use The item () method or an array syntax(faster and preferred method) we can select element using class attribute or tag names or css selector, we cam loop through the nodelist.
