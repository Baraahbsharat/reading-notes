CSS deal with Each Html element as being in a box which might be block element ( start on a new line ) or inline element (between the text ), if one block element contain another block element the outer box known as a containing or parent, the schemes for the layout  include : normal flow (position : static ), relative positioning( position : relative ), absolute positioning (position : absolute ), fixed positioning ( position : fixed ), box offset tell the browser how far from the sides the box should be. Z-index used to determine which element place on the top. Float element allows us to put the element in the right or left, to prevent the element  from touching the box from the left or right we use clear, to use multiple  column in the design we use < div > element the page mostly around 960 and 1000 pixels wide to deal with different screen sizes and different resolution, while fixed width layout prevent the size changing when the browser window size changed which is the opposite of liquid layout design, css framework allow us to use specific codes to apply the css, we can have several stylesheet and inside the head we can put each one in a link element,
