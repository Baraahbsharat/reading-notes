The order execution means that some task can not be run until other tasks done, the Javacsript process the code line by line , when we execute context, activity of preparation followed by activity of execute happened, each execution context  has it's own variable object, javascript errors reflected by an exception, the errors can be shown by the browser, we can treat errors either by debug the script to fix errors or by handling errors gracefully (if we know the code might fail we can use try, catch, finally).  we can make several things using console ( helps in make the error area narrower ) such as, console log or info or warn or error or group or table or assert, each one with specific function, we can make a break in the script using breakpoint, we can determine that the breakpoint occur after a specific condition, Several types of errors can be done in the javascript such as differences from the basics and missing or extra characters or data type issues, Debugging is the process of finding errors.
