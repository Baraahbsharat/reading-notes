links 

There are various types of links such as links move me from one site to another and links let me move across several pages of the same site and others types, < a> element used to create a link, we can specify the page that we want to reach it using href attribute, UL refers to uniform resource locator, it represent the address that we type on the browser to reach that page, if the page was in the same folder the file name wrote inside the href, within our site we can use relative URL to link pages, and it had several types for example, same folder, child folder and grand child folder, to link to an email the href attribute starts with mailto:, when we use target attribute in < a> we link to open in a new window, we can specify each element in the HTMl by using id and then we can in the href write # symbol and the id of that element.

layouts

CSS deal with each html element as if they inside a box this box can be block level element ( start on a new line ) or inline element ( present within surrounded text, if tow block level elements were inside each other the outer box known as the container or the parent element, we can add position theme in the css  and it could be normal flow ( each block on top of the next one ), relative position(move element in relation to its place in the normal flow) or absolute position (  the box taken out of normal flow ), box offset properties tell the browser how much distance from the top, button, left and right sides. Fixed position make the position value fixed, z- element property control sites on top, float property allow us to position the element in right or left, if we want not to allowed to any element to touch the left or right side of the box we can use clear, < div> element represent column in each page. Our design should be appropriate for all screen sizes and and resolution by  create the page around 960-1000 pixel wide, liquid lay out allow adaptation as the used increase or decrease the screen size, to make a fixed width layout the main box should be in pixel, composition in the visual art means the location and the arrangement of of visual elements, instead of making css from the beginning we use a framework, we can have multiple css files on one page.
