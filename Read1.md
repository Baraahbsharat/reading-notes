The text editor is part of the software that enable the user to write and deal with texts easily, especially when we develop a websites. There is various classifications for the text editors which might come with the computer itself, such as " Text Edit " that come with Mac computers and " Note pad " that come with windows computer. On the other hand, there are several editors that can be downloaded such as Notepad ++, BB Edit and Atom. As a software developer choosing an appropriate text editor can be related to their choice, which depends on the features that they preferred to find in that text editor. Most text editor are similar, but it can be distinguished based on specific features like code completion which allow suggestions for you during writing, or syntax highlighting that allow you to color your text and many other features that might you preferred, so software developer must be aware about their chosen tool to write their codes.

Command line or terminal is a text that we typed from the keyboard and get feedback on it,  inside the command we have shell that determine the shape and action of that command and the most common shell is called bash different commands had different using, for example if we typed pwd and run it, the current location in the file system can be known, and when we type Ls the content of the file will be appeared, also when we type cd as a command  we can change the file. As we determine the command line argument it is called path. Path can be either related to to our current location that called relative path, or it could be related to the root of the file system to be known as absolute path.    

If you write your commands using Linux remember that everything is considered as a file, it doesn't matter what the extension of the file that we have because it will go through the file and decide based on its content what is the file' type, not like the windows, but at the same time it is highly sensitive to the letter to be upper or lower case then we must be careful to that during the command writing.
