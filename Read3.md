Version control is a system to revisit the different versions of the file and it is easy through it to know the mistakes and correcting it. We have local version that store the different versions in a database to return to it, and we have the Generalized version that allowed file storing at the same time allowed different clients to access the files like programmers or administrators as a more collaborative way of revision. On the other hand the Distributed version allowed us to make a mirrored repository to manage any lost information. Git store files at a snapshot that edited with each changes and it works with a local operation which means we can continue working even without being online, on Git it is difficult to lost files.
