When we want to connect HTML,CSS,JavaScript languages together it present within a separate files that works as a separate layer, HTML responsible about the page structure, and the css responsible about the page style while the Javascript responsible about the page behavior. JavaSscript run anywhere in the HTML file, the JavaScript file had the extension of .js. The script is a group of instructions that known as statements. We must notice that the javaScript is case sensitive. Each JavaScript statement present and a seperate line and end by a semicolon, to help ourselves and others we can add comments about the script and if it is a single line we use // to apply it or if it is multiline /* is used. In the script we can use several type of data that might be Numerical as numbers or it might be string that means letters and other characters and it might be boolen which is either true or false. we use var to clarify the variable and give it a name which must follow a certain rule to be accepted as a name.
