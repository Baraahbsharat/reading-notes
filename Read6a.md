JavaSscript run anywhere in the HTML file, the JavaScript file had the extension of .js. The script is a group og instructions that known as statements. We must notice that the javaScript is case sensetive. Each JavaScript statement present and a seperate line and end by a semicolon, to help ourself and others we can add comments about the script and if it is a simgle line we use // to apply it or if it is multilines /* is used. In the script we can use several type of data that might be Numrical as numbers or it might be string that means letters and other charactars and it might be boolen which is either true or false. we use var to clarify the varible and give it a name which must foloow a certain rule to be accepted as a name.
