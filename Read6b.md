Computers as a thinking machine mainly works on four stages that include taking an input, storing it, make a processing and then give an output. In the beginning the older computers were larger and slower than those days computers, it is started as a basic calculators but know it can receive different type of information like sounds, numbers images, texts and storing all of these and deal with it as a several commands. Inside the computer there is wires and circuit that hold these information. The smallest form of information that the computer store is bit. The computer use the BINARY number system that only had 0 and 1 that can represent any type of the previous mentioned information. Millions tiny electronic component come together and form circuits. If we give the circuit 0 as input the output will be 1. There are several simple small logical circuit in the computer such as and, or, not. All of the complex operation in the computer are the result of many small and simple operations.
The central processing unit taking the input and converting it into numbers and tell the computer what to do with it, the computers need more memory and more power to apply more advance actions and the central processing unit knows which circuit to use and when to use it.
