Operator and Loop 
We can use script to evaluate a situation by comparing a value to an expected value, the result might be true or false, == means Is equal to ? , != means Is not equal to ? === known as strict equal , !=== known as strict not equal to, > greater than , < less than those known as comparison value that give us either true or false result, we can compare these comparison values using logical operators, && means logical and, || means logical or, ! means not. While means code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is true, Do while to run the command at least one even if the condition evaluate to false, For used when we know how many times the loop should run. For loop use a counter as a condition which might be initialization in which we create a variable for example i and give it the value zero, or we can add a condition in which the loop continue running until a specific number or we can update in which every time the loop will add a number to the counter.
