HTML and CSS required as raw material to be understood from the designers, website editors and managers to help them in their dealing with the web, We can open the web pages via different methods such as using the web browser ( e.g. chrome ) that used the web server which connected to the internet and allow people to reach that page, to find the location of the web server we first connect to a Domain Name System server that tells the computer the IP address ( 12 digit ) to reach the page.  We can open the web page from various devices such as laptops and phones, All websites using both HTML and CSS in addition to any extra content, HTML is required to understand how to build the structure of the page, while the CSS is required to control the page's style, page  structure is important to understand the page, for example using the headings and subheadings make it easier to understand the page, HTML codes lives inside angled bracket and it made of opening and closing tags, inside the opening tags we can add attributes that add more information related to the element, the attributes made of name and value it must be lowercase, <title> element content shown in the tab/bar of the browser, To expand our knowledge about the HTML we can look toward the source code of the page, or read books or online tutorials. There are different versions of HTML, such as HTML 4  in 1997, HTML 1.0 in 2000, each web page should begin with DOCTYPE declaration to tell the browser which version of HTML is using, we can use <!-- --> to add invisible comments to the code, which can be shown from the source code. WE can either specify element from other elements using id attribute or specify elements from other elements using class attributes, a block level element appear to start on a new line while the inline element appear to continue on the same line, we can use <div> element to group set of elements together in one block-level box. Many of the <div> elements replaced by new HTML 5 layout elements. <iframe> element used as a window to see other pages from your page, <meta> element lives inside the head and contain information about the web page. <header> and <footer> elements can be used for the main header and footer or the for specific <article> or <section> across the page, while the <article> element used as a container for the <section> element. Older browser that can not understand the HTML 5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level. Every website designed for audience with special characteristics related to their age, gender, education level) and if it target a company we must know it is size, position of employees and budget, we need to know their goals and motivations to visit  our page, and how often they will do that, we can manage the structure of the site by either site maps or wireframe, and to make our page easier to understand we can make organizing or prioritizing, and visual hierarchy.The first step in programming is to understand the script and how to create one, which consist of a series of instructions that a computer can follow step by step to achieve a specific goal, to create it we must determine our goal, then write steps toward that goal and code each one, we can write the steps as a flowchart which shows paths between the steps, and it must be written in an understandable language from the computer, so we must understand the vocabulary and syntax of that language, and we must learn about the programmatic approaches that solve the problems. Computers create models of the world using data, object represent the physical thing, while properties referred to it's characteristics, a script determine which event the programmer wants to respond to. The browser receive the page as HTML code and create a model of it and save it in the memory, then used a rendering engine to show page on screen, each major browser used a Javascript interpreter to translate the instruction to the computer, Javascript is a text file that preferable to be in a separate file with js. extension, we can use the <script> element to tell the browser to load the Javascript file.
